# Mad Quality Plugin II 

Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Eaque corporis minima obcaecati fugiat tempora excepturi mollitia delectus consequatur minus quidem?

With the Mad Quality Plugin II you can automatically check the quality of your topics in Flare. 

You can check for both structural problems, 
- such as `<p><h1>Lorem ipsum</h1></p>`, 
- and for language problems, such as the passive voice in `The plugin is used for checking quality`

The main things you can use it for are:
1. Self-editing - making sure your content is as good as possible before publication, or handing it over to a human editor. 
2. Enforcing style guide compliance in a team of writers. 

The plugin comes pre-loaded with a set of rules based on the [Microsoft Manual of Style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), as well as a collection of structural rules, and you can also set up your own rules.

> Setting up rules requires Microsoft Excel, or a software that can edit .xlsx files.
