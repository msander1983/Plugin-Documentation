# Mad Quality Plugin II 
With the Mad Quality Plugin II you can automatically check the quality of your topics in Flare. 

You can check for both structural problems, 
- such as `<p><h1>Lorem ipsum</h1></p>`, 
- and for language problems, such as the passive voice in `The plugin is used for checking quality`

The main things you can use it for are:
1. Self-editing - making sure your content is as good as possible before publication, or handing it over to a human editor. 
2. Enforcing style guide compliance in a team of writers. 

The plugin comes pre-loaded with a set of rules based on the [Microsoft Manual of Style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style),  as well as a collection of structural rules, and you can also set up your own rules.
